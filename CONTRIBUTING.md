# Contributing to Deconst Client

If you want to contribute to deconst-client, please consider contributing to [Kitematic](https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic) first! Whenever possible, I'd prefer to see Kitematic get better and better, and periodically merge relevant changes from upstream, rather than diverge.

If you do want to contribute something deconst-client specific, welcome and thank you! The [Kitematic contributing guide](https://github.com/kitematic/kitematic/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) has some handy pointers on development prequisites and development environment setup that you should read.
